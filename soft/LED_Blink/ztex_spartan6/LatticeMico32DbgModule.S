**  Name: LatticeMico32DbgModule.S
**
**  Description:
**        Implements system-calls for the following operations
**          LatticeMico32DbgWrite:  write-char over LatticeMico32 jtag uart
**          LatticeMico32DbgRead: read-char over LatticeMico32 jtag uart
**          LatticeMico32DbgOpen: open file for LatticeMico32 jtag uart
**          LatticeMico32DbgClose: close file (LatticeMico32 jtag uart)
**
**        All of these calls do a branch to the LatticeMico32 debug
**        monitor and hence these functions require the processor's debug
**        Module enabled in MSB.
**        User does not have to bother calling these functions as
**        LatticeMico32 acts as a file-device and is available for
**        stdio operations including fopen and printfs (in addition to
**        fread, fgets, fscanf etc).

**   This source code is intended as a design reference which
**   illustrates how these types of functions can be implemented.  It
**   is the user's responsibility to verify their design for
**   consistency and functionality through the use of formal
**   verification methods.  Lattice Semiconductor provides no warranty
**   regarding the use or functionality of this code.
